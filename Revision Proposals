1) Moving structural element to become an input for Element
2) Adding optional Composite Component
          - Enables option of multiple cross-sections/composites pr element group
          - If cross-section is inputeted to element, it will become a "composite" with one part
          - Enables alignment of composite
3) Node Group component is added on the left side of the assembly.
4) Node Property component connects to NodeGroup
5) Support is moved to Detailing Group
6) Added 3 Group Property Descriptions (Length, name, amount)
7) Rearrenged order: Assembly->Global Analisys->Detailing->Output
8) Added components for extracting detailing properties
            Assembly->DetailingGroup->Element/Node->Property
9) Added Cut/Drill/Pocket component
10)  Renamed output/inputs to Assembly (Proposal: Output/Input is assembly that are being incrementally informed by global analysis and detailing
11) Detailed model is able to have 4 outputs: Local Analysis, Feasability check, Brep Model, Export BTL
